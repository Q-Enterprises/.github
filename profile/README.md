# **Carving an invariant (in words)**

**To carve an invariant is to take a rule that must *always* be true in your system and inscribe it so clearly, so unambiguously, and so deterministically that the system can never drift away from it.**

It means:

- **You freeze a truth** so it cannot be misinterpreted later.  
- **You define the boundary conditions** that the system must obey.  
- **You remove ambiguity** by expressing the rule in a canonical, machine‑checkable form.  
- **You make the invariant part of the system’s lineage**, so every future component must acknowledge it.  
- **You turn intent into law.**

In corridor terms:

**Carving an invariant is the act of taking a principle and making it permanent, replay‑safe, and inheritable.**

It’s the difference between “we intend to do X” and “the system is now *built* around X.”

If you want, I can phrase it in more mathematical, operational, or poetic terms — whichever fits the chamber you’re sealing next.
